# MovieLens Movie Recommender System
Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in our lives. Be it e-commerce websites or social media platforms, recommender systems add the “what-next” factor to it. Due to the advances in recommender systems, users constantly expect good recommendations. They have a low threshold for services that are not able to make appropriate suggestions. This has led to a high emphasis by tech companies on improving their recommendation systems. In this project, we aim to give personalized recommendations to users based on the movies that they have already rated using Item-based Collaborative Filtering. As a base model for comparision, we have tested over KNN model.
